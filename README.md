# Phase-1-Code-challenge-1
My first code challenge in phase 1
Week 1 Toy problems Prerequisites Prerequisites:

Create a repository on your GitHub account.
NB: One folder, with 3-4 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution.

Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.

Push the solution to the above repository once done.

Submit the repository link for grading.

Ensure your repository has a well written README.

NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenges.

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below:

    A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

The repository contains some projects: -The Students Grade Calculator -The Speed Detector -The Net Salary Calculator

$$ GRADE CALCULATOR FOR STUDENTS it calculates students grade between 0 and 100 the grade ranges are; A=80-100 B=60-79 C=50-59 D=40-49 E=LESS 40

$$ SPEED DETECTOR It writes the program that takes speed of a car as input e.g 80 if the speed is less than 70 it should print "ok" And for every 5km/s above the speed limit(70) it should give the driver demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

$$ NET SALARY CALCULATOR Its major task is to calculate individual salary by inputing basic salary and benefits .calculate payee,NHIF deductions,NSSF deductions,gross salary and net salary.
